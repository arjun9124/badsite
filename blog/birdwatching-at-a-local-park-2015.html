So here I am posting another one of my photography adventures. Here are some pictures from a little birdwatching trip at a local park that happened sometime in 2015. <br>
<h3>Backstory</h3><br> It was year 2015, it had been only a few months that I had started persuing photography as a hobby. I had recently got a Nikon Coolpix S9900 and me and by dad would frequently take time out of our weekends to have fun with the camera. <br>
